# SWE Survival

A collection of software engineering problems with AI model solutions, tracking both original responses and corrected versions.

## Structure

- `problem_XX/` - Individual problem directories containing:
  - `README.md` - Problem description and requirements
  - `problem_XX_model_YY_original.py` - Original model response
  - `problem_XX_model_YY_correct.py` - Corrected/improved version

## Models Tested

| Model ID | Model Name | 
|----------|------------|
| 01 | Sonnet 4.5 | 
| 02 | Sec | 

## Usage

Each problem directory contains standalone solutions that can be run independently. Refer to individual problem READMEs for specific requirements and setup instructions.
